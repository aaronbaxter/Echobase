Echobase: OSM and SRTM Tile Generator
Created to support the Echoscape Project - https://github.com/owenchapman/Echoscape
========

The Echobase Tile Generator application generates tiles from OSM (http://www.openstreetmap.org/) and SRTM (http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org) data for use in the Echoscape app.  The tiles 0.02 by 0.02 degree tiles of terrain data (SRTM) and street and building data (OSM). 

The application is written in PHP and all necessary functions are in the echobase_classes.php file.  The cron.php file can be run to auto-generate the tiles required based on a set of input coordinates.  Each time this is run, it checks the Echoscape data directory to populate a list of existing tiles and then compares that to those required by the input set of coordinates. The coordinate set in this case are those from the audio-mobile database (http://audio-mobile.org/).

In order to reliably create tiles on demand, the source data for each dataset was hosted locally (~30GB).

	osmfilter - The osmfilter exectuable, download from http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmfilter

Generating Terrain Tiles
Terrain tiles are generated by grabbing the necessary points from the SRTM source data in the /raw/srtm directory. The zipped .asc file is extracted into the /tmp directory and the necessary tiles are created.

Generating OSM Tiles
OSM data is generated from the latest OSM planet file (http://planet.osm.org/). The Planet file was then split into 5 by 5 degree tiles using osmconvert (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmconvert) and the unrequired attributes were removed using osmfilter (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmfilter).
